# Summary

These Spinnaker integration tests depend on the
[Cloud Integration Testing](https://github.com/google/citest) python package.
You'll need to run the setup script to install the dependencies into your
environment, then can run the tests at will.

To write new tests refer to existing tests and see
[the citest README.md](https://github.com/google/citest/blob/master/README.md)
gifor the time being, and ask questions on the
[Spinnaker #dev slack channel](https://spinnakerteam.slack.com/messages/dev/).

# About This Subtree

This part of the repository is divided into the following parts:

Directory           | Purpose
------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------
`tests`             | The actual Spinnaker integration tests.
`spinnaker_testing` | Support modules for the Spinnaker integration tests.
`unittests`         | Unit tests for parts of spinnaker_testing.

# Installing dependencies

## Install and Create a Virtual Env

These tests are written in Python. Instead of installing the dependencies into
system folders consider using something like
[virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/). This is optional, but
suggested.

    # Install the python package manager if you dont already have it
    sudo apt-get install python-pip

    # Instal FFI package needed by pyopenssl
    sudo apt-get install libffi-dev libssl-dev python-dev

    # Install virtualenv tools  and setup a Virtual Environment.
    pip install virtualenv

    # Create an environment to use.
    MYENV=my-virtualenv   # to clarify documentation
    virtualenv $MYENV     # create a new environment directory

    # Use the environment for a session (in the current shell).
    source $MYENV/bin/activate  # use $MYENV in the current shell
    ...
    deactivate            # leave the virtualenv when you are done

If you are using Virtual Env, then all the remaining instructions would be
performed within the virtual environment, entered by `source
$MYENV/bin/activate` within the shell you run the commands in.

## Install citest Dependencies

The citest library is not yet published to a pip repository so you need to clone
the citest repository and install it from there.

```
# From another directory, such as the parent directory to this repository.
cd <parent directory>
git clone https://github.com/google/citest.git
cd citest
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then navigate back to the Spinnaker testing directory and install the
requirements for the Spinnaker testing library.

```
cd <parent directory>/buildtool/testing/citest
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

When executing tests, the `buildtool/testing/citest/spinnaker_testing` library
needs to be added to your `PYTHONPATH`, e.g.

    cd buildtool/testing/citest
    PYTHONPATH=.:spinnaker_testing python <test name>.py <args>

## Install Platform Dependencies

Installation of platform-specific tools are not yet automated. Depending on the
platforms involved either by hosting Spinnaker or being the platform the test is
running against, you may need additional tools.

Platform              | Tools     | Installation Command
--------------------- | --------- | --------------------
Amazon Web Services   | awscli    | `sudo apt-get install -y awscli`
Microsoft Azure       | az        | [See instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
Google Cloud Platform | gcloud    | `curl https://sdk.cloud.google.com`
Kubernetes            | kubectl   | [See instructions](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/prereqs/)
DC/OS                 | dcos      | [See instructions](https://dcos.io/docs/1.9/cli/install/)

# Preparing a deployment to test against

Normally these tests do not require any particular type of deployment. The tests
themselves can be run from anywhere provided they can gain access to the
microservices and backend services they need to talk to.

You can run the tests against any standard deployment. The tests will typically
inspect your configuration and adapt themselves if possible while providing
command-line flags for remaining parameters or overrides for what it may find.

Some tests require unique parameters, or may require certain features enabled in
order to test them, but even so do not typically dictate any particular values
beyond the feature being properly enabled in standard ways.

2016-09-22 The documentation is sparse at this time. Currently only the
bake_and_deploy test requires special configuration, which is basically a
Jenkins job that it can trigger. Even there, the triggering information is
passed to the test via command-line arguments. Instructions for this can be
found in the test itself:
[bake_and_deploy_test.py](https://github.com/spinnaker/buildtool/blob/master/testing/citest/tests/bake_and_deploy_test.py)

## Providing access

If your deployment is firewalled in a way that the machine you are running from
cannot normally access the service endpoints then you will need to tunnel in or
use one of the other suggestions recommended for users to gain access to the
Spinnaker UI. While these tests do not use the UI, the networking techniques are
the same.

If Spinnaker is deployed on the Google Cloud Platform, the tests will tunnel
into them if you use the `--gce_[project|zone|instance]` parameters. Otherwise,
if you use --native_hostname then you must tunnel in (or provide some other
means).

### Providing the SSH passphrase

If spinnaker tunnels on your behalf, it will need your ssh passphrase. Since the
tests are meant to be automated, these can be implicit by running something like
ssh-agent in the shell you are running the tests from, or you can create a file
containing the passphrase and pass the path on the command-line using
--ssh_passphrase_file. If using the file, be sure to protect it using `chmod
200`.

# Running the tests

## Optional configuration for exposing deployment configuration

Some configuration parameters in tests can be discovered from the runtime
services rather than relying on manual flag passing. However doing so requires
that the server security configuration be loosened up with the following
configuration parameters which will expose the /resolvedEnv endpoint of
microservices as well as prevent Spring from redacting the values of some
sensitive values. While the tests do not rely on getting the senstive values
from the server, they wind up getting exposed (and possibly logged) as
collateral damage.

Again, this particular configuration change is entirely optional.

In spinnaker-local.yml, add the following:

```
management:
  security:
    enabled: false

endpoints:
  resolvedEnv:
    keys-to-sanitize: password,secret,key,token
```

## Standard Parameters For Talking To Spinnaker

The following parameters can be passed on the command-line using a flag
`--`*<parameter_name>*`=`*<parameter_value>*.

### Platform Independent Parameters

Flag            | Description
--------------- | --------------------------------------------------------
native_hostname | The hostname (or IP address) for the Spinnaker endpoint.
native_port     | The portnumber for the Spinnaker endpoint.

### When Spinnaker Is Deployed on GCE

When spinnaker is on GCE you can use the `native_hostname` flag, or these custom
flags which will locate the instance for you. If using the flags below, citest
will automatically attempt to tunnel into the instance if it is not already
reachable.

Flag | Description
-----|------------
gce_project | The Google Cloud Project *running spinnaker* is used to locate spinnaker on GCE.
gce_instance | The name of the Google Cloud Instance that the instance is running on.
gce_zone | The name of the Google Cloud Platform zone the instance is in.
gce_ssh_passphrase_file | The path to the passphrase file for tunneling. Alternatively, you can run something like ssh-agent.

## Standard Parameters Controlling Created Resources

These parameters are typically obtained from the deployed Spinnaker where
possible, and if not have default values so do not need to be specified.

Flag | Description
-----|------------
test_stack | The default Spinnaker Stack to specify in test operations. Setting this could be helpful to identify where resources have come from if you have a shared environment where multiple people or accounts can be running tests independently.
test_app | The Spinnaker application name to use for the test. The tests usually set a default unique name.
managed_gce_project | The Google Cloud Platform for the project that GCE is
managing.
test_gce_zone | The Google Cloud Platform zone you prefer to deploy test
resources into.
test_gce_region | The Google Cloud Platform region you prefer to deploy test
resources into.
test_gce_image_name | The default Google Compute Engine image name to use
when creating test instances requiring an image.
aws_iam_role | The Spinnaker IAM role name for test operations.
test_aws_zone | The Amazon Web Services zone you prefer to deploy test
resources into.
test_aws_region | The Amazon Web Services region you prefer to deploy test
resources into.
test_aws_ami | The default Amazon Web Services Machine Image name to use
when creating test instances requiring an image.
test_aws_vpc_id' | The default AWS VpcId to use when creating test resources.
test_aws_security_group_id: The default AWS SecurityGroupId to use when
creating test resources.
test_azure_rg_location | The azure location where the test resources should be created. Default to westus.
azure_storage_account_key | The key used to read the content from the Azure storage account used by Spinnaker when Spinnaker is configured to use Azure Storage for front50.
azure_storage_account_name | The name of the Azure storage account used by Spinnaker when Spinnaker is configured to use Azure Storage for front50.

### Account Information

Flag | Description
-----|------------
spinnaker_google_credentials | The name of the Spinnaker [clouddriver] account that you wish to use for Google operations. If not specified, this will use the configured primary account.
spinnaker_kubernetes_credentials |  The name of the Spinnaker [clouddriver] account that you wish to use for Kubernetes operations. If not specified, this will use the configured primary account.
spinnaker_aws_credentials |  The name of the Spinnaker [clouddriver] account that you wish to use for Amazon Web Services operations. If not specified, this will use the configured primary account.
spinnaker_azure_account | The name of the Spinnaker [clouddriver] account that you wish to use for the Azure operations. If not specified, this will use the configured primary account.
spinnaker_dcos_account | The name of the Spinnaker [clouddriver] account that you wish to use for DC/OS operations. If not specified, this will use the configured primary account.
spinnaker_dcos_cluster | The name of the DC/OS cluster associated to spinnaker_dcos_account to use for DC/OS operations.

## Standard Parameters For Configuring Observers

Flag | Description
-----|------------
gce_credentials_path | The path to a service account JSON credentials file used by the test to verify effects on GCE. The permissions needed on the account may vary depending on what the test is doing. You can use the same service account that you have configured spinnaker with,
aws_profile | The name of the awscli profile to use when verifying effects on AWS. The permissions needed in the profile may vary depending on what the test is doing. You can use the same AWS credentials as those you configured spinnaker to use.
azure | For Azure, you must login with the following command on the test environment ```az login -u SPN_Client_ID -p SPN_Application_key --tenant Tenant_Name --service-principal``` prior to test execution.

## Typical Invocations

Typical tests assume that the platform running Spinnaker is independent of the
platform providing the resources that Spinnaker is managing. Therefore, a
typical invocation has three sets of commandline parameters. One set specifies
"spinnaker" things, another specifies "managed resource" things, and lastly,
additional "observer" things.

    # Assuming cwd is buildtool/testing/citest
    PYTHONPATH=.:spinnaker_testing \
    python tests/<fixture name>.py \

# Usage Examples

Assuming you are in the `buildtool/testing/citest` directory and testing against
GCE where:

    PROJECT_ID=ewiseblatt-spinnaker-test
    INSTANCE=ewiseblatt-20150805
    ZONE=us-central1-c

then:

    PYTHONPATH=.:spinnaker_testing python \
      tests/google_kato_test.py \
      --gce_project=$PROJECT_ID \
      --gce_instance=$INSTANCE \
      --gce_zone=$ZONE \
      --gce_ssh_passphrase_file=$HOME/.ssh/google_compute_engine.passphrase

If you were testing against some "native" host:

    PYTHONPATH=.:spinnaker_testing python \
      tests/google_kato_test.py \
      --native_host=$HOSTNAME \
      --managed_gce_project=$PROJECT_ID \
      --test_gce_zone=$ZONE

Note that `google_kato_test.py` is written to specifically test managing GCE
instances regardless of where Spinnaker is running from. So you can run it
against an AWS deployment, but will still be observing changes on GCE.

An example testing managing AWS instances, with Spinnaker running on a "native"
host where:

    HOSTNAME=localhost  # IP address where spinnaker is running.
    PROFILE=test        # user creates profile for aws cli tool outside citest.
    ZONE=us-east-1a     # an AWS zone.

then:

    PYTHONPATH=.:spinnaker_testing python \
      tests/aws_kato_test.py \
      --native_host=$HOSTNAME \
      --aws_profile=$PROFILE \
      --test_aws_zone=$ZONE

Note that `aws_kato_test.py` is written to specifically test managing AWS
instances regardless of where Spinnaker is running from. So you can run it
against a GCE deployment, but will still be observing changes on AWS.
