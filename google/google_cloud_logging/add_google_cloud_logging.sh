# This should install Google Cloud Logging to the current instance
# and add a custom Spinnaker configuration to it in addition to the
# standard ones.
#
# This requires that the current instance have scope for
#    https://www.googleapis.com/auth/logging.write.
#
# If you do not then you are hosed and need to create a new instance because
# scopes are only introduced at construction time.
#
# If you are very much tied to this instance, you can detatch the disk, destroy
# the instance, turn the disk into a new image, then create a new instance off
# that image. Otherwise, just create a new instance.
#
# Since logging.write is added by default, you might have created this
# instance using an older C2D.
# Each of these has been updated to add logging-write so you can use the
# same procedure as before, but with the current versions.
